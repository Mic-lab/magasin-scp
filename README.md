## Description

Magasin SCP is a simple web app that allows Franco-Ouest students to access their stamps. Within the website, they can first create an account with their full name, school email address and a password. Later, they can log in to access the amount of stamps they have acquired during the year, and purchase rewards that they desire. Teachers on the other hand can login to access and manage their students stamps.

Our main technologies that we used were HTML, Bootstrap, Flask and SQLite. Our biggest difficulties were figuring out what technologies suited best for our needs, figuring out what features we wanted the website to have, and creating the authentication portion of the website. We do not plan to implement any new features in the nearby future, but rather, we hope to maintain the website as it gets used.

## How to use the website

1. Create an account with your first name, last name, school email address and password
2. Login to your account to view the amount of stamps you have
3. Purchase any rewards that you want based on your balance
4. Logout when you are finished
